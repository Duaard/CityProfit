# City Profit

This was an assignment on Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course. I've already done the exercise in Octave, this project is to help me get familiar with the different libraries in Python.

## Problem

Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.

You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.

## Data

The file **data.txt** contains the dataset for our linear regression prob- lem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.

Here is the first ten entries of the data
| Population in 10,000s | Profit in \$10,000s |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| 6.1101                | 17.592              |
| 5.5277                | 9.1302              |
| 8.5186                | 13.662              |
| 7.0032                | 11.854              |
| 5.8598                | 6.8233              |
| 8.3829                | 11.886              |
| 7.4764                | 4.3483              |
| 8.5781                | 12                  |
| 6.4862                | 6.5987              |
| 5.0546                | 3.8166              |
